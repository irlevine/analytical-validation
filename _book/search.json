    "text": "2 IVD Methodologies\nThe validation and characterization of in vitro diagnostic tests (IVDs) stand on a foundation of best practices, primarily articulated in the consensus guidance documents published by the Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI). These documents, shaped by input from the FDA and leading product development companies, form the industry standard. However, practitioners frequently encounter ambiguity in the application and statistical interpretation of the CLSI guidelines. While sophisticated tools, such as the mcr, VCA, and VFC statistical packages pioneered by companies like Roche, have helped standardize some methodologies, a significant need remains for a practical, in-depth explanation of these statistical concepts. This book aims to provide that missing practical context and statistical clarification, offering a comprehensive resource to successfully navigate IVD test validation.\nThe scientific IVD methods used in this book include immunoassay, PCR/molecular diagnostic, clinical chemistry and hematology.",

    "text": "3 Calibration Math Models\nCalibration is the process that establishes the relationship between the measured instrument signal (e.g., light absorbance, fluorescence) and the actual concentration of the substance being tested.\nThis established relationship is referred to as the dose-response curve. The mathematical function used to accurately represent and model this relationship is called the calibration curve.\nBy using this curve, the signal from an unknown sample to be accurately converted into a final result, whether that measure is qualitative (present/absent), semi-quantitative (low, medium, high), or quantitative (e.g., 4.5 mg/dL).\nFor the focus of this book, mathematical calibration models are continuous monotonic functions. This is required to assure that the signal for any sample corresponds with a unique concentration. If the mathematical calibration model is not a continuous monotonic function, then there could be more than one concentration associated with a single signal, or there may be no concentration associated with a signal at all.",
